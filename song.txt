I thought that I've been hurt before.
But no ones ever left me quite this sore.
Your words cut deeper than a knife.
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life.
Got a feeling that I'm going under.
But I know that I'll make it out alive.
If I quit calling you my lover.
Move on.
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe.
Shaking, falling onto my knees.
And now that I'm without your kisses.
I'll be needing stitches.
